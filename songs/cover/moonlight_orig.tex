\beginsong{Moonlight Shadow}[by={Mike Oldfield}]

\beginverse
The last that ever she saw him
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
\endverse

\beginchorus

Lost in a river last Saturday night
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through
\endchorus

\beginverse


The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
\endverse

\beginchorus
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through
\endchorus

\beginchorus

I stay I pray
I see you in heaven far away
I stay I pray
I see you in heaven far away
\endchorus

\beginverse
Four am in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
\endverse
\beginchorus
Star was light in a silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through
\endchorus

\beginchorus
I stay I pray
I see you in heaven far away

I stay I pray
I see you in heaven far away
Far away on the other side.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
The night was heavy but the air was alive
She couldn't find how to push through

Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Far away on the other side.
\endverse
