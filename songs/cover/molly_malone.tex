\beginsong{Molly Malone}[by={Dubliners}]

\beginverse
In \[C]Dublin's fair \[Ami]city, where the \[Dmi]girls are so \[G]pretty
I \[C]first set my \[Ami]eyes on sweet \[D7]Molly Ma\[G7]lone
As she \[C]wheeled her wheel \[Ami]barrow through \[Dmi]streets broad and \[G]narrow
Crying \[C]cockles and \[Ami]mussels \[D7]alive a-\[G7]live \[C]O!
\endverse

\beginchorus
A-\[C]live a-live \[Ami]O! A-\[Dmi]live a-live \[G]O!
Crying \[C]cockles and \[Ami]mussels \[D7]alive a-\[G7]live \[C]O!
\endchorus

\beginverse
She was a fishmonger and sure it was no wonder
For so were her father and mother before
And they both wheeled their barrows through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
\endverse

\beginchorus

A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
\endchorus

\beginverse

She died of a fever and no one could save her
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
Now her ghost wheels her barrow through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
\endverse

\beginchorus

A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
\endchorus
