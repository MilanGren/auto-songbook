\beginsong{Stand By Me}[by={Ben E. King}]

\beginverse       
\[C]When the night has come

\[Am]And the land is dark
                                      
And the \[F]moon is the \[G]only light \[C]we'll see

No, I won't be afraid,
      
No, I \[Am]won't be afraid
                                    
Just as \[F]long as you \[G]stand, stand by \[C]me.
\endverse


\beginchorus
So, darling, darling, stand by me,
    
Oh, \[Am]stand by me.

Oh, \[F]stand, \[G]stand by \[C]me,

Stand by me.
\endchorus


\beginverse      
If the sky that we look upon

Should tumble and fall

Or the mountain should crumble in the sea,

I won't cry, I won't cry,

No, I won't shed a tear

Just as long as you stand, stand by me.
\endverse


\beginchorus
So, darling, darling \dots
